The `@repo/auth` package exposes an `AuthProvider`, however you don't need to use this directly. The [`DesignSystemProvider`](/features/design-system/provider) includes all relevant providers and higher-order components.

From here, you can use all the pre-built components and hooks provided by Clerk. To demonstrate this, we've added the `<OrganizationSwitcher>` and `<UserButton>` components to the sidebar, as well as built out the Sign In and Sign Up pages.

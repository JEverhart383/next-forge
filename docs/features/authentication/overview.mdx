next-forge manages authentication through the use of a `auth` package. By default, this package is a wrapper around [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) which provides a complete authentication and user management solution that integrates seamlessly with Next.js applications.

It also provides a series of helpful utilities and components for managing authentication in the app.

## Configuration

next-forge has a default configuration for Clerk, enabling users and organizations to be managed.

### Local Development

Currently there's no way to easily test Clerk webhooks locally, so you'll have to test them in a staging environment. This means deploying your app to a "production" state Vercel project with development environment variables e.g. `staging-api.example.com`. Then you can add this URL to your Clerk project's webhook settings.

next-forge manages authentication through the use of a `auth` package. By default, this package is a wrapper around [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) which provides a complete authentication and user management solution that integrates seamlessly with Next.js applications.

It also provides a series of helpful utilities and components for managing authentication in the app.

## Configuration

next-forge has a default configuration for Clerk, enabling users and organizations to be managed.

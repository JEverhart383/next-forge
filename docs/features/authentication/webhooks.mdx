Clerk uses webhooks to handle authentication events. These are handled in the `POST /webhooks/clerk` route in the `api` app. Make sure you enable the webhook events you need in your Clerk project settings.

### Local Development

Currently there's no way to easily test Clerk webhooks locally, so you'll have to test them in a staging environment. This means deploying your app to a "production" state Vercel project with development environment variables e.g. `staging-api.example.com`. Then you can add this URL to your Clerk project's webhook settings.
